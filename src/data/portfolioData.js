  about: `
I’m a passionate and driven pre-final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram Campus. 
My interests revolve around embedded systems, artificial intelligence, IoT, and full-stack development — fields that bridge innovation and practical engineering.

I believe in learning by building. Over the past few years, I’ve immersed myself in hands-on projects that combine hardware, software, and design thinking. 
I enjoy developing smart systems that respond to real-world challenges — whether that’s an IoT-driven irrigation system, an Android app built from scratch, or an intelligent assistant that automates tasks.

Currently, I’m refining my skills in C programming, Python, and React. I aim to secure a challenging internship or early career opportunity where I can apply my technical skills and creativity to solve complex engineering problems. 
My long-term goal is to contribute to embedded systems and AI-driven product innovation in a leading tech organization.
